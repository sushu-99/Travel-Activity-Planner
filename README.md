# Travel Activity Planner

The Travel Activity Planner is a project aimed at providing personalized travel itineraries using Generative AI. It leverages advanced algorithms to prioritize activities based on user preferences and budget constraints. Additionally, it integrates with the Google Maps API to retrieve comprehensive information about attractions and restaurants. The project includes an intuitive web interface developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for users to input their preferences and view their personalized day plans.

## Features

- **Generative AI Model**: Designed and developed a generative AI model to create personalized travel itineraries.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Utilized the Google Maps API to retrieve information about attractions and restaurants.
- **Web Interface**: Created an intuitive web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for users to input preferences and view day plans.

## How It Works

1. **Input Preferences**: Users provide information such as destination, travel dates, budget, and interests through the web interface.
2. **Generate Itinerary**: The generative AI model processes the user input to generate a personalized travel itinerary.
3. **Prioritize Activities**: Algorithms prioritize activities based on user preferences and budget constraints.
4. **View Day Plans**: Users can view their personalized day plans through the web interface, including attractions, restaurants, and suggested activities.
